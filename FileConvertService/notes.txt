Creating service

Making console app and using topshelf

To install use the admin command prompt

Windows 10 windows key + x

Then change the directory to the exe file in the bin debug folder

cd /d incase command prompt won't change

Using topshelp is is just our exe install

update the service by servicename uninstall / install

If you run VS in admin mode you can attach to the service process and debug it through VS!

Send custom commands to service using sc.exe

sc control AwesomeFileConverter 200


serviceConfig.RunAs("username", "password")
serviceConfig.RunAsLocalSystem();
serviceConfig.RunAsLocalService();
serviceConfig.RunAsNetworkService();
serviceConfig.RunAsPrompt(); -- will be prompted on username /password

serviceConfig.StartManually();
serviceConfig.StartAutomatically();
serviceConfig.SeartAutomaticallyDelayed();  //add the delay
